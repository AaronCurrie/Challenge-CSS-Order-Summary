## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used this challenge to practice my CSS layout and design skills. The main features I choose to use were CSS flexbox as the project was relatively small and didnt requrie CCS grid. I tried to keep the project as responsive as possible by using 10% and rem's as well as a media query at the pages main breaking point.
